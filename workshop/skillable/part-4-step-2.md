## Part 4 - Step 2: Connect to the Cupcake Store MCP Server

A chatbot that only chats is just an expensive parrot. To actually *do*
things - check what flavors are in stock, place an order, mark it ready
for pickup - the agent needs **tools**.

> **What is MCP?** The **Model Context Protocol** is an open standard
> for letting AI agents talk to external systems. An MCP server publishes
> a set of tools (functions the agent can call), prompts (reusable
> instruction snippets), and resources (data) over HTTP. Your agent just
> needs the URL - the framework handles discovery and invocation. The
> Cupcake Store team already runs an MCP server with all the cupcake
> tools you need.

Two changes to your 'agent.py':

1. Import 'MCPStreamableHTTPTool', point it at the server's URL, and call 'connect()'.
2. Pass it to the 'Agent' via 'tools='.

The agent will discover the available tools automatically and decide when
to call them based on what you ask.

```python-notype
"""Sparkles - The Cupcake ordering agent"""

import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStreamableHTTPTool   # 👈 updated
from agent_framework.foundry import AnthropicFoundryClient

# 1. Load environment variables from .env
load_dotenv()

async def main() -> None:
    # 2. Configure the chat model (Claude on Microsoft Foundry)
    chat_client = AnthropicFoundryClient(
        model=os.environ["FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT"],
        api_key=os.environ["FOUNDRY_API_KEY"],
        base_url=os.environ["FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT"],
    )

    # 3. Connect to the Cupcake Store MCP server                 👈 new
    mcp_tool = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
        name="cupcake-store",
        url="https://ca-cupcake-mcp.jollyplant-ed217b0d.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp/",
    )
    await mcp_tool.connect()

    # 4. Create the agent
    agent = Agent(
        client=chat_client,
        name="cupcake-agent",
        tools=mcp_tool,                                          # 👈 new
    )

    # 5. Start a chat session and talk to the agent
    session = agent.create_session()
    print("Type 'exit' to quit.\n")

    while True:
        user_input = input("\033[1;35mYou:\033[0m\n")
        if user_input.lower() in ("exit", "quit"):
            break

        response = await agent.run(user_input, session=session)
        print(f"\n\033[1;35mAssistant:\033[0m\n{response.text}\n")

    await mcp_tool.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Run it:**

In the VS Code terminal at the bottom of the editor, run:

```bash
python agent.py
```

**Try it:**

Send the message `What flavors do you have today?` to the agent.


Type 'exit' when you're done to stop the agent.

The agent is now calling MCP tools on the Cupcake Store server. But it's
still acting like a generic assistant - it has no persona yet.

✅ **In this step you have:** connected your agent to the Cupcake Store
MCP server, and watched it call live tools to answer real cupcake
questions.
