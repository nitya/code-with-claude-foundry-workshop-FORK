# Build AI Agents using Claude in Microsoft Foundry

Welcome to **Sparkles**, the friendliest little cupcake shop on the
internet. Sparkles has a problem most bakeries would love to have: too
many customers, too many flavors, and not enough hands behind the
counter. So today, you're going to hire some help - an AI agent that can
greet guests, walk them through the day's flavors, take their order, and
hand them a freshly baked cupcake on the way out.

You'll start by logging in to **Microsoft Foundry**, where you'll meet
**Claude Sonnet** waiting for you in the Playground. After a quick chat
to make sure you two get along, you'll grab the deployment's endpoint and
key and bring them home to your code editor.

From there, you'll build the agent up one small step at a time using the
**Microsoft Agent Framework**. First, a bare-bones "hello world" agent
that proves you can reach the model. Next, you'll plug it into the
**Cupcake Store MCP server** so it gains real superpowers - listing
flavors, checking stock, placing orders. Finally, you'll let the MCP
server hand the agent its own persona and welcome banner, turning a
generic chatbot into Sparkles itself.

By the end, you'll have ordered a cupcake from an agent you built from
scratch - and learned how Foundry, the Agent Framework, and MCP fit
together along the way. 

> **What is Microsoft Foundry?** Foundry is Microsoft's hosted platform

> Anthropic, Mistral, your own fine-tunes), give them an endpoint and a
> key, and then wire them into your code. Think of it as the cloud
> control panel for the brains of your agent.
